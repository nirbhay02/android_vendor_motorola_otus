android_vendor_motorola_condom
==============================

Proprietary Blobs for Motorola Moto E [Condor] taken from https://github.com/Motorola-CyanogenMod/proprietary_vendor_motorola

These have been renamed for use with otus. My blobs extracted from otus haven't been allowing me
to boot, so I'm starting with condor blobs and changing the vendor tree blob by blob to figure
out which blob breaks boot.
